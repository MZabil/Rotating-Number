# Rotating-Number
Making rotations in a number based on user input
 
Q. Define a function named ‘rightCircular’ using C++ language which takes in four integers as arguments and rotates their values to right. For instance, if the parameter list consists of variables a,b,c,d and the passed arguments are 2,8,3,7.  After the function call, the respective values of a,b,c,d should be 7,2,8,3. Define another similar function named ‘leftCircular’ which rotates the values of the four passed arguments to left. Write a C++ program which prompts the user to enter two characters and five integers in the following order; character, integer, integer, character, integer, integer, four-digit integer  
The values of character variables can either be ‘l’ for left or ‘r’ for right. The first integer after both characters indicates the number of shifts required and the second one indicates the additive constant to be added to each digit of the four-digit integer supplied as the fifth input.  
Your program should calculate the value and display result on screen. A sample output is given below. You will have to separate the digits of the fifth input before passing them to circular shift functions.
